-1-. Create a function that can go to the next GPS point

2. Create a program that saves GPS points to a file because nobody
wants to read of the debug window the coordinates so just
place the turtle and name the position and boom it's saved | Maybe it's more useless

-3-. don't ask like a retard in the GUI. Make a config file and
make it happen except it's an emergency or smth.

4. Try to go the same path back to the chest.

-5-. Make a blacklist for blocks you can't dig and a list of ore blocks

6. Make location offline possible. Meaning that
you don't need a satelite to get your location
except on the beginning. Maybe not even then
when working only with deltas
